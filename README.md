# DigraphLifter


This code generates a directed k-cycle then lifts it by crossing the original vertex set with the Abelian group ZM and the original dart (directed edge) set by Z2xZM. Each original dart (i,j) where i, j in Zk becomes ((i, m), (j, m+a)) and ((i, m), (j, m+b)) where i, j, m, a, b, m+a and m+b are elements of ZM, and a and b are voltages.
